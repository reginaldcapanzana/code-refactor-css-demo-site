## Description
Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:
- What was your motivation?

- What problem does it solve?

The objective of this project was to practice code refactoring, in this case to make the site more accessible. Web accessibility ensures that people with disabilities can access a website using assistive technologies. Accessibility is both good for business and for the company to avoid litigation.

I was tasked with reviewing the code and seeing where I can make improvements on the site's accessibility and design. In the index.html file, I revised the existing code by adding semantic html, adding alt attributes where needed, updating the title, and adding comments. In the style.css file, I grouped the selectors based on their type and added comments. The updated site should look like the screenshot below.
